# Robotic Vision Arm
## Introduction
<br>
Machine vision in one of the key technologies in manufacturing because of increasing demands on the documentation of quality and the traceability of products. It is concerned with engineering systems, such as machines or production lines that can perform quality inspections in order to remove defects or controlling other aspects.[1]
## About Sherlock
<br>
Sherlock is an advanced machine vision software interface that can be applied to a wide variety of automated inspection applications. It offers maximum design flexibility and provides a rich suite of proven tools and capabilities that have been deployed in thousands of installations worldwide.[2]
## About the Robot Arm 
<br>
The AL5A robotic arm delivers fast, accurate, and repeatable movement. The robot features: base rotation, single plane shoulder, elbow, wrist motion, a functional gripper, and optional wrist rotate all this controlled by SSC-32 Servo Controller via serial communication to the computer and the camera.[3][4]
## Development​:
<br>
The objective of this practice is to see a practical approach of the usage and advantages of machine vision.
<br>
The implementation consist on these main steps:
- A camera which detects the pattern of a piece.
- The arm which takes the piece from the start point.
- The manipulation of the piece
- The setting of the piece on its corresponding place
